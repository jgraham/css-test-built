  <title>CSS-UI test: outline-offset width negative values â€” long box</title>
  <link href="http://florian.rivoal.net" rel="author" title="Florian Rivoal" />
  <meta content="should" name="flags" />
  <meta content="Negative values on outline-offset should not cause the height and the width of outside of the shape drawn by the outline to become smaller than twice the computed value of the outline-width property, applying this constrain separately for each shape if there are several shapes." name="assert" />

<style>
span {
  outline: solid green 25px;
  outline-offset: -35px; /* Any value that makes sure the outlines collide ( &lt; -25px )
                            would make the test valid,
                            -35px is just one such value that happens to make the failures pretty.
                            I recommend looking at this test in as many UAs as possible,
                            the results are quite astonishing.
